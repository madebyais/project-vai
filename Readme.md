PROJECT VAI - INEQUALITY CALCULATOR
-----------------------------------

Project VAI is a project that I've been working on for three days. There are two folders, nodejs and python.

Nodejs, the project is build using NodeJS v6.11.3. I'm using several common node modules, such as express, mysql, and so on. And for the prediction algorithm, I'm using [regressionjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regression) for the linear regression method.

Python, the project is build using Python v2.7.0. There are several libraries that I used for developing the project, such as Flask, mysql.connector and so on. Since there is a prediction task, I'm using Sci-Kit library for the linear regression method.

I researched on the web and also asked several friends who know statistics and machine learning, and found out that the easiest way to predict a value in the future is by using linear regression method. So, that's why I decided to use it.

p.s. I just learn python yesterday (28 October 2017), so sorry if the python structure is a bit messy :)

If you can't run the application, please don't hesitate to contact me by email at faris@monolog.id or madebyais@gmail.com
